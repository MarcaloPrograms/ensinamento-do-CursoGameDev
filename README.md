## Hi There, I'm Marcelo!

- 👀 I’m interested in evolve as a programmer, as it is an area that attracts my attention.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of programming concepts, such as (variables/if,elif,else/for,while), but I intend to learn and evolve much more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the best way I can, I'm still a beginner, so I won't be able to be of much help hehehe, but I intend to strive to help others, and of course, become a great programmer.
